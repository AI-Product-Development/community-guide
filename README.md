# 🧠 AI Product Development: Community Guide

![AI Product Foundary](./assets/ProductFoundaryAI_SplashScreen.png)


Welcome to the **Community Guide** — a shared, open repository for learning resources, how-to guides, and real-world workflows in AI product development.

Our goal is to **collaboratively build a practical knowledge base** that helps people move from beginner to confident builder across topics like:

- 🤖 AI Agents & Automation
- 🧩 Low-code / no-code workflows
- 🛠️ Real-world product development
- 🧠 Prompt design and LLM usage
- 🧪 Experimentation, testing, and iteration
