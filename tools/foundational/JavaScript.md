# üìú JavaScript: The Language of the Web

JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, versatile programming language primarily known for making web pages interactive. It runs directly in web browsers (client-side) but is also widely used on servers (Node.js), in mobile apps, and for scripting tasks.

## üöÄ Why Use JavaScript?

*   **Web Interactivity:** Essential for creating dynamic user interfaces, handling user input, and communicating with servers without page reloads (AJAX/Fetch).
*   **Full-Stack Development:** With Node.js, you can use JavaScript for both frontend and backend development, simplifying the tech stack.
*   **Large Ecosystem:** Access to a vast collection of libraries and frameworks (React, Angular, Vue, Express, etc.) via package managers like npm and yarn (or `uv`).
*   **Asynchronous Programming:** Built-in support for handling operations like network requests or file I/O without blocking the main thread.
*   **Community Support:** One of the largest and most active developer communities.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation / Setup

JavaScript execution environments are typically needed in two places:

1.  **Web Browsers (Client-Side):**
    *   **No installation needed!** All modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) come with built-in JavaScript engines. You write JS code in `.js` files and include them in your HTML using `<script>` tags.

2.  **Server-Side / Command Line (Node.js):**
    *   **Download Node.js:** Go to [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)
    *   **Recommendation:** Download the **LTS (Long Term Support)** version for stability.
    *   **Installation:** Run the downloaded installer. Ensure the option to **"Add to PATH"** is selected. This makes `node` and `npm` (Node Package Manager) available in your terminal.
    *   **Verification:** Open your terminal (like PowerShell or Git Bash) and run:
        ```bash
        node -v
        npm -v
        ```
        This should display the installed versions.

## üí° Getting Started

### 1. Basic Syntax (Browser Example)

*   Create an `index.html` file:
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>JS Test</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Hello JavaScript!</h1>
        <button id="myButton">Click Me</button>

        <script src="script.js"></script> 
    </body>
    </html>
    ```
*   Create a `script.js` file in the same directory:
    ```javascript
    // Select the button element
    const button = document.getElementById('myButton');

    // Add an event listener for clicks
    button.addEventListener('click', function() {
        alert('Button was clicked!');
        console.log('Button click logged to console.'); 
    });

    // Basic variable declaration
    let message = "Welcome!";
    const year = 2025; 

    console.log(message, "The year is", year); 
    ```
*   Open `index.html` in your web browser. Click the button. Open the browser's developer console (usually F12) to see the `console.log` messages.

### 2. Basic Syntax (Node.js Example)

*   Create a file named `hello.js`:
    ```javascript
    function greet(name) {
      return `Hello, ${name}!`;
    }

    const userName = "World";
    const greeting = greet(userName);

    console.log(greeting); // Output: Hello, World!

    // Simple calculation
    const sum = 5 + 10;
    console.log(`5 + 10 = ${sum}`); // Output: 5 + 10 = 15
    ```
*   Run it from your terminal:
    ```bash
    node hello.js 
    ```

### 3. Package Management (Node.js with npm or uv)

*   **Initialize a project:** Navigate to your project folder in the terminal.
    *   Using `npm`: `npm init -y` (creates `package.json`)
    *   Using `uv` (recommended, see [UV.md](./UV.md)): `uv init` (creates `pyproject.toml` but manages Node packages too if Node is present)
*   **Install packages:**
    *   Using `npm`: `npm install <package-name>` (e.g., `npm install express`)
    *   Using `uv`: `uv add <package-name>` (Note: `uv` primarily focuses on Python but can interact with `package.json` if needed for Node projects)
    *   Packages are downloaded into a `node_modules` folder.
