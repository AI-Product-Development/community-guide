# Architecture Guide: Mock Stock Market Data API

## 1. Selected Architecture Pattern

*   **Pattern:** Monolithic API Service
*   **Justification:** The requirements outline a focused API with a limited scope (providing mock data). A monolithic structure using FastAPI is simple to develop, deploy, and manage for this prototype stage. It avoids the overhead of microservices for a relatively straightforward application.

## 2. State Management

*   **Backend State:** Primarily stateless. Each API request will contain all necessary information. Mock data generation logic will be self-contained or rely on a simple, static dataset loaded at startup or on demand. No complex backend state synchronization is required for this mock data API.

## 3. Technical Stack

*   **Backend:**
    *   Language/Framework: Python 3.10+ / FastAPI
    *   Database: SQLite (for simplicity in the prototype)
    *   ORM: SQLModel (if storing/managing mock data definitions becomes complex, otherwise potentially just in-memory generation or reading from static files)
    *   Data Generation: Python libraries (e.g., `random`, `datetime`, potentially `pandas` if loading static seed data)
*   **Authentication:** None required for the initial prototype. The API will be open.
*   **Key Integrations:** None required.

## 4. Authentication & Authorization Flow

*   Not applicable for the initial prototype. The API endpoints will be publicly accessible without authentication.

## 5. High-Level Route Design

*   **Backend API Endpoints:**
    *   `/quotes/{symbol}`: Get the latest mock quote for a specific stock symbol.
    *   `/historical/{symbol}`: Get mock historical price data for a specific symbol (supports date range query parameters).
    *   `/symbols/`: (Optional) List available mock symbols.
    *   `/docs`: Standard FastAPI Swagger UI for documentation.
    *   `/redoc`: Standard FastAPI ReDoc documentation.

## 6. API Design Philosophy

*   **Core Principles:** RESTful. Use standard HTTP methods (GET) and clear resource-based URLs.
*   **Versioning:** Not required for the initial prototype. If needed later, URL path versioning (e.g., `/v1/quotes/...`) is recommended.
*   **Error Handling:** Use standard HTTP status codes (e.g., 404 Not Found for unknown symbols, 422 Unprocessable Entity for invalid parameters, 500 Internal Server Error for generation issues). FastAPI's default exception handling will be used, potentially with custom handlers for specific errors. Responses will be in JSON format, including error details.

## 7. Database Design Overview

*   **Database Type:** SQLite (Initial Prototype).
*   **Data Models:** Primarily focused on representing the mock data structure for generation and response.
    *   `Quote`: Represents a single stock quote (symbol, price, timestamp, etc.).
    *   `HistoricalPrice`: Represents a single historical data point (symbol, date, open, high, low, close, volume).
*   **Persistence:** Mock data might be generated on-the-fly or loaded from a predefined static dataset (e.g., CSV file) at startup. SQLModel/SQLite might be used if we need to store configuration or definitions for the mock data generation itself, but not necessarily for storing the generated mock data long-term. The Data Architect will provide detailed SQLModel definitions if database persistence is required.

## 8. Deployment & Infrastructure Overview

*   **Target Hosting:** Local development environment initially. Can be containerized using Docker for easier distribution and deployment to cloud platforms (e.g., AWS ECS, Azure App Service, Google Cloud Run) if needed later.
*   **CI/CD:** Basic linting and testing pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) can be set up. Automated deployment is out of scope for the initial prototype.
