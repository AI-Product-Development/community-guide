# Product Requirements Document: PromptSculptor API (Prototype v1)

## 1. Elevator Pitch

PromptSculptor is an API designed for developers building AI-powered applications. It provides tools to programmatically analyze, refine, and generate AI prompts, ensuring they are clear, effective, and tailored to specific needs, ultimately improving the quality of AI-generated outputs. This initial prototype focuses on core analysis, remixing, and creation functionalities.

## 2. Who is this app for?

This initial API prototype is primarily for **Software Developers** and **Prompt Engineers** who need to integrate prompt optimization and generation capabilities directly into their workflows, tools, or applications.

## 3. Functional Requirements (Prototype v1 Scope)

The initial prototype will focus on the following core API endpoints:

*   **`POST /analyze`**:
    *   **Input:** A user-provided text prompt.
    *   **Processing:** Analyzes the prompt for potential weaknesses (e.g., vagueness, excessive length). Calculates a "clarity score" (details of calculation TBD, potentially involving length, keyword analysis, structural checks). Identifies potential areas for improvement.
    *   **Output:** JSON response containing the clarity score, identified issues (e.g., `["Vague", "Too Long"]`), and brief suggestions for improvement.
*   **`POST /remix`**:
    *   **Input:** A user-provided text prompt and optional parameters specifying desired remix styles (e.g., `style=["shorter", "more_detailed"]`).
    *   **Processing:** Generates several variations of the input prompt based on the requested styles. Default styles if none are provided might include 'shorter', 'more detailed', 'simpler language', 'more assertive'.
    *   **Output:** JSON response containing a list of remixed prompt strings.
*   **`POST /create`**:
    *   **Input:** A simple description or goal for a desired prompt (e.g., "Generate a python function to read a csv file"). Potentially include target audience or complexity level as parameters.
    *   **Processing:** Uses an LLM (like the one powering the API itself) to generate a well-structured initial prompt based on the input description.
    *   **Output:** JSON response containing the generated prompt string.

**Out of Scope for Prototype v1:**
*   `/test` (multi-LLM testing)
*   `/contextualize` (persona adaptation)
*   `/history` (prompt versioning)
*   `/combine` (fragment merging)
*   Bonus Features (Tone Detector, PromptGPT Mode, Leaderboard)
*   User accounts, authentication, rate limiting (focus is on core functionality first)

## 4. User Stories (Prototype v1)

*   **As a developer integrating prompt generation, I want to call the `/create` endpoint with a simple goal description, so that I can quickly generate a baseline prompt for my application's users.**
    *   *Example:* Input `{"goal": "Explain photosynthesis to a 5th grader"}` to `/create`, receive `{"prompt": "Explain the process of photosynthesis in simple terms suitable for a 10-year-old, covering sunlight, water, carbon dioxide, chlorophyll, oxygen, and glucose."}`.
*   **As a prompt engineer, I want to send a draft prompt to the `/analyze` endpoint, so that I can get a clarity score and identify specific areas like vagueness or excessive length.**
    *   *Example:* Input `{"prompt": "Make a story."}` to `/analyze`, receive `{"clarity_score": 35, "issues": ["Vague", "Lacks Context"], "suggestions": ["Specify genre, characters, setting, or plot points."]}`.
*   **As a developer building a prompt editing tool, I want to call the `/remix` endpoint with a user's prompt and selected styles (like 'shorter' and 'simpler language'), so that I can offer the user alternative phrasings.**
    *   *Example:* Input `{"prompt": "Elucidate the methodologies employed in the fabrication of semiconductor devices.", "styles": ["shorter", "simpler_language"]}` to `/remix`, receive `{"remixes": ["Explain how computer chips are made.", "Describe semiconductor manufacturing methods simply."]}`.

## 5. User Interface

This prototype is **API-only**. There will be no graphical user interface (GUI) developed for this initial version. Interaction will be purely programmatic via HTTP requests to the defined endpoints. Documentation (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger) will be provided.
