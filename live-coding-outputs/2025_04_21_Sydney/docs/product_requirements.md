# Product Requirements Document: Mock Stock Market Data API

## Elevator Pitch

A simple, reliable API providing realistic but mock stock market data (quotes, historical prices) for development, testing, and educational purposes. It allows developers to build and test financial applications without needing access to expensive or complex live market data feeds.

## Who is this app for?

*   **Developers:** Building financial applications, dashboards, or trading bots who need sample data for development and testing.
*   **Students/Educators:** Learning about financial markets or teaching concepts requiring stock data examples.
*   **Testers:** Needing consistent, predictable data for testing financial application features.

## Functional Requirements

*   Provide API endpoints to retrieve mock stock quotes for specific symbols.
*   Provide API endpoints to retrieve mock historical price data (e.g., daily open, high, low, close) for specific symbols over a date range.
*   Data should appear realistic but be programmatically generated or based on a static, fictional dataset.
*   The API should be well-documented (e.g., using OpenAPI/Swagger).
*   Endpoints should return data in JSON format.
*   (Optional) Allow basic filtering or querying (e.g., by date, by symbol).
*   (Optional) Include fictional company information alongside stock symbols.

## User Stories

*   As a developer, I want to request the latest mock quote for "AAPL" so I can display it in my test application.
*   As a student, I want to retrieve the last 30 days of mock historical price data for "MSFT" so I can practice data analysis techniques.
*   As a tester, I want to consistently receive the same mock data for a specific symbol and date range so I can write predictable integration tests.
*   As a developer, I want to easily understand how to use the API by reading clear documentation.

## User Interface

*   This is primarily an API, so the main "interface" is the API endpoint structure and the documentation.
*   A simple web page providing API documentation (e.g., generated by FastAPI's Swagger UI) is required.
*   (Optional) A basic landing page explaining the API and how to get started could be beneficial.
